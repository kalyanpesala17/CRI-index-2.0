# CPAL's CRI-index-2.0
Created a child resource index health score for 1172 census tracts in Dallas, Collin, Tarrant and Denton. CRI 1.0 provides a measure for community strengths and weaknesses to policymakers, stakeholders, and residents to make data-driven decisions. IN CRI 2.0 we have added more indicators and Implement individual weightage for each indicator based on how strongly the indicator predicts health outcomes, which improves the predictive validity of the index.
