# CRI-index-2.0
CPAL wishes to carry the CRI forward and transition the index from one based on the relationships across DISD campuses, and instead establish an index that measures a set of indicators more specific to CPALâ€™s mission of mitigating the root-drivers of child poverty. A revised CRI will incorporate additional datapoints that are actionable by local organizations, be drawn from reliable data that can be expected to be consistently available and provides a clear measure for community strengths and weaknesses to policymakers, stakeholders, and residents. CPAL will use the recommendations from this course to update the index in 2020.
