# CRI-index-2.0
CPAL wishes to carry the CRI forward and transition the index from one based on the relationships across DISD campuses, and instead establish an index that measures a set of indicators more specific to CPALâ€™s mission of mitigating the root-drivers of child poverty. A revised CRI will incorporate additional datapoints that are actionable by local organizations, be drawn from reliable data that can be expected to be consistently available and provides a clear measure for community strengths and weaknesses to policymakers, stakeholders, and residents. CPAL will use the recommendations from this course to update the index in 2020.

# Project Motivation
Created a child resource index score for 1172 census tracts in Dallas. Collin, Tarrant and Denton based on community, economics, education, family, and health and visualized in tableau dashboard.       
Implemented linear regression to calculate individual weights for each indicator based on how strongly the indicator predicts health and economic outcomes, which improves the predictive validity of the index.       
Expanded the number of indicators to make community index more robust.
